Goal:

- outperform redis on a benchmark on multi-core for subset of ops


TODO:

DONE - add set/get/delete key val

- represent as Ops
    - Op can serialise to string. Yay.

WIP - find resp grammar
    WIP - parse RESP
    - compose RESP

- make ops consume resp and return resp?

- single map in server

- add tests (under race detector) to trigger
    - can just inject Ops into a server instance
    - although going over protocol allows test against redis

- add performance measure (ops/sec under a defined load)
    - or is there a redis-bench

- start performance table
    - compare redis with goredis?

- add mutex
    - take performance measure

- add 2x or 10x sub-maps, with hash of key -> submap
    - mutex on submap
    - take performance measure

- try actor-model submap
    - take performance measure
